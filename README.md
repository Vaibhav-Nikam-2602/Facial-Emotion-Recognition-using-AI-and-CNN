AI-based facial emotion recognition using CNN and FER2013 dataset
# Facial Emotion Recognition using AI and CNN 😄😢😡

This project uses **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to recognize human emotions from facial expressions in images. It is trained on the **FER2013 dataset** and supports real-time emotion detection via webcam.

## 🔍 Overview

Facial expressions are a vital part of human communication. This AI-powered system automates the process of detecting emotions like:

- Happy 😊
- Sad 😢
- Angry 😠
- Surprise 😲
- Fear 😨
- Disgust 🤢
- Neutral 😐

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras (for CNN)
- OpenCV (for image capture & preprocessing)
- Streamlit or Flask (for user interface)
- FER2013 Dataset (Kaggle)

## ⚙️ How the AI System Works

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Images resized to 48x48, normalized
2. **CNN Model** – Trained on FER2013 to classify 7 emotions
3. **Prediction** – Softmax layer outputs real-time emotion
4. **Live Detection** – Uses webcamor Images  to detect and classify faces
